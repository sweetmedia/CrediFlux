"""
Core admin configuration for dynamic settings (Constance)
Following Unfold's official integration pattern:
https://unfoldadmin.com/docs/integrations/django-constance/

When 'unfold.contrib.constance' is added to INSTALLED_APPS before 'constance',
the Unfold styling is automatically applied to the Constance admin interface.

No manual registration is needed - the integration handles it automatically.
